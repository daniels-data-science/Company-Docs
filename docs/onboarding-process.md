# Welcome to Gopher Industries, the MedTech and HealthTech Incubator at Deakin University!

We are thrilled to have you join us at Gopher Industries, where we collaborate to create innovative solutions in the medical and health technology field. This guide will provide you with all the essential information to get started and thrive in our community.

## Our Structure

At Gopher Industries, we embrace a flat organizational structure that fosters group leadership and contributions. Instead of traditional roles like CEOs or CTOs, we emphasize the value of contributions made by students (yes, you!) to our products.

## Our Operations: "The Three C's"

Our operations are based on what we call "The Three C's": Code, Communication, and Coordination.

### Code

We utilize GitHub as our code repository. All our product repositories are housed within a company-wide GitHub Organization. Our Git Leads help manage and coordinate activities, as well as establish agreed-upon policies. If you have a good knowledge of GitHub, your contributions in this area will be highly valuable.

Here is a link to our GitHub: [Gopher Industries · GitHub](https://github.com/gopher-industries)

Here are our Git Leads: EREENA BAGGA and JYHE MARK

### Communication

For direct communication with students and updates about events, we use MS Teams. Our Comms Leads manage this communication and also handle Company-wide OnTrack submissions.

Here are our Comms Leads: VANESSA JOSEPHINE MATTEA

### Coordination

Trello serves as our main source of truth for all ongoing activities in Gopher Industries. We adopt a tailored SCRUM framework to meet our needs, and Product Backlog Leads are responsible for managing the product backlog on each Trello board.

Our Trello Workspace is located here: [Gopher Industries Trello Workspace](https://trello.com/invite/gopherindustries3/ATTIfc98e6ebf94d61601f09d91a7ce2e06e82383EF8)

Our Product Backlog Leads are: DAN EASTAUGH, NAVRAJ DEEP KAUR, XINYAO CHENG, and GUBEIBEI SUN

## Our Products

Starting this trimester, Gopher Industries will focus on a few key products to ensure quality and efficiency, putting previous products on hold. These products are categorized as follows:

### Major Products

1. Guardian Activity Monitor
2. NutriHelp Diet and Nutrition Planner

### Minor/Experimental Product

1. Food Remedy API

## Our Contributors

At Gopher Industries, we recognize Lead Contributors and Contributors, and the distinction is made by you!

### Contributors

As a contributor, you are expected to make technical or professional skills contributions to the company. These contributions may include but are not limited to programming, coding, documentation, data processing, onboarding materials, communication plans on products, logo design, wireframes, risk assessments, policy documents, and research on tooling, privacy, or ethics concerns.

### Lead Contributors

As a lead contributor, you are expected to lead any of the above contributions. This could involve leading a Product Backlog Item in our Trello workspace, volunteering on the InnoFes Planning Committee, being an InnoFes company representative, being a Product Backlog Lead, being one of the GitHub Leads, being a member of the Leadership channel, and coordinating the submission of Company Tasks such as 2.1P, 6.1P, and 11.2P.
