### **How can I access/edit the Trello Boards? (updated)**

[Trello workspace link](https://trello.com/invite/gopherindustries3/ATTIfc98e6ebf94d61601f09d91a7ce2e06e82383EF8)

You need to use your Deakin login to be able to access the Trello Boards. Only leadership teams or members that significantly contribute to a project will be granted admin access to them. This is to prevent accidental deletion of cards and maintain control of the project. If you require access, contact the admins (DAN EASTAUGH, NAVRAJ DEEP KAUR, XINYAO CHENG, and GUBEIBEI SUN).

### **How can I access the Gopher GitHub? (updated)**

GitHub link: [Gopher Industries · GitHub](https://github.com/Gopher-Industries)

If anybody already has a GitHub account that you would prefer to use, feel free to drop your username / email to JYHE MARK or EREENA BAGGA to get access as contributors to the GitHub organization. Otherwise, you can add by using your student email. Then you will receive invitations to your Deakin email by them.

### **I cannot edit the project GitHub. How do I make code changes?**

The project repositories are locked to prevent accidental pushes and merges. Any changes to our repositories must be made via a pull request. This includes code changes, documentation updates, and adding or removing files. The pull request should be reviewed by at least one other team member before being merged.

### **How do I know my role in the company?**

You will either have joined the company as a part of Capstone Unit Part A (SIT374/SIT764) or Capstone Unit Part B (SIT378/SIT782). If you are enrolled in Part A, you are a junior member of Gopher Industries, and if you are enrolled in Part B, you are a senior member.

### **What about specific roles? (updated)**

For specific roles, you need to volunteer for a role within a project/s that reflects your course learning outcomes. The Gopher Industries leadership team will not be allocating specific roles, it is your job to ensure you take on one relevant to your course. This will allow you to display your skills and make significant contributions to our projects.

### **How can I contribute as a member of Gopher Industries? (added) (need to update)**

At Gopher Industries, we have lead contributors and contributors, which is decided by you. As a contributor, you are expected to make technical or professional skills contributions to the company, which include but not limited to programming, coding, documentation, data processing, onboarding materials, communication plans on products, logo design, wireframes, risk assessments, policy documents, and research on tooling, privacy, or ethics concerns. As a lead contributor, you are expected to make contributions that lead any of the above contributions. This could involve leading a Product Backlog Item in our Trello workspace, volunteering on the InnoFes Planning Committee, being an InnoFes company representative, being a Product Backlog Lead, being one of the GitHub Leads, being a member of the Leadership channel, and coordinating the submission of Company Tasks such as 2.1P, 6.1P, and 11.2P.

### **I want to get a D/HD grade. How can I achieve this?**

Distinction and High Distinction grades require you to contribute lasting contributions to the company. For junior students, a distinction level grade involves being dedicated to engaging actively in the project, understanding the broader context, and learning from and actively supporting the current leaders. A high distinction for senior students involves demonstrating how you have shown excellence in what you have achieved in the capstone program.

### **How does Gopher Industries manage communication among team members? (added) (need to update)**

Gopher Industries manages communication among team members with Microsoft Teams, a collaborative communication platform. Here is how the company facilitates communication within the team:

- **Microsoft Teams:** Gopher Industries uses Microsoft Teams as the primary communication tool. It provides a centralized space for team members to exchange messages, share files, hold meetings, and collaborate on projects.

- **Channels:** Within Microsoft Teams, Gopher Industries creates different channels based on topics or projects. This helps organize discussions and keeps conversations relevant to specific areas, preventing information overload.

- **Direct Messages:** Team members can also communicate one-on-one through direct messages on Microsoft Teams. This allows for private discussions and quick exchanges of information between individuals.

- **Comms Leads:** Gopher Industries designates Comms Leads who are responsible for managing and overseeing communication channels. They ensure that important announcements, updates, and event information are shared with the team effectively.

- **Announcements and Updates:** Important announcements and updates related to projects, events, or company-wide initiatives are posted in designated channels. This ensures that all team members stay informed and are on the same page.

- **Meeting Scheduling:** Microsoft Teams can be used to schedule and host virtual meetings, making it convenient for team members to collaborate regardless of their physical locations.

- **Document Sharing:** The platform allows for easy sharing of documents, files, and resources related to projects. This promotes seamless collaboration and ensures that all team members have access to the necessary information.

- **Integrations:** Gopher Industries may integrate other tools and apps into Microsoft Teams to further enhance communication and collaboration. For instance, integrations with Trello or GitHub may streamline project management and code sharing.

- **Inclusive Communication:** Gopher Industries fosters an inclusive communication culture, where all team members are encouraged to participate and contribute their ideas and feedback. This promotes a sense of belonging and teamwork within the company.

### **What are Product Standup Meetings, and how often are they held? (added) (need to update)**

Product Standup Meetings are a type of regular team meeting held within Gopher Industries to facilitate coordination and progress updates for specific product development projects. These meetings are brief, focused, and typically held on a schedule. Each project team will meet once a week. There will be a team meeting one fortnight and then a sprint review with the company director the next fortnight. The times and days for the meetings for each project will be listed in the Meetings tab at the top of the Gopher Industries General channel.

Here is an overview of what Product Standup Meetings entail:

- **Purpose:** The main purpose of Product Standup Meetings is to keep the team informed about the progress of ongoing projects, identify any potential roadblocks or challenges, and ensure that everyone is aligned with the project's goals and tasks. These meetings also promote accountability and foster a sense of shared responsibility among team members.

- **Format:** Product Standup Meetings are usually short and time-boxed to ensure efficiency. The term "standup" comes from the practice of keeping the meeting participants standing to encourage brevity and focus. Each team member provides a brief update on their individual progress and what they plan to work on next.

- **Key Components:** During a typical Product Standup Meeting, team members cover the following key components:

  - *What I Did Yesterday:* Each team member shares a brief overview of the tasks they completed or the progress they made on the previous day.

  - *What I am Working on Today:* Team members outline the tasks they plan to work on during the current day or the specific goals they aim to achieve.

  - *Any Roadblocks or Issues:* If a team member is facing any challenges or roadblocks that may hinder their progress, they mention it during the meeting to seek assistance or support from the team.

  - *Coordination and Collaboration:* Standup Meetings provide an opportunity for team members to coordinate efforts, ask questions, and collaborate on tasks that may require joint efforts.

### **What happens if I cannot make a meeting?**

The fortnightly sprint review meetings with the company director will be recorded. The fortnightly team meetings will not. This is to allow an honest, open discussion. We understand not everyone will be able to make each meeting, so try to pick a project that you can make the most meetings for. Otherwise, contact your project leader to gain an update and volunteer for some roles.

### **How do I track my contributions to capstone? (updated)**

You need to download the Worklog Excel template provided in the Files tab in the Gopher Industries General channel. Then record the date, duration, activity type, and description of your contributions. Depending on the activities, it is advised you log approximately 100-150 hours (depending on your target grade) to pass capstone units. If you need further assistance, reach out for help from XINYAO CHENG.

### **Do I get to pick what products I want to join? (updated)**

We encourage you to contribute across the board; not to work themselves into one product only. But also, there will be a Google document to update in Teams General to show your interest in products in Gopher. Please wait for more information on the Teams Channel on this.
