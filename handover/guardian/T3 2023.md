### Project Team

- **Project Name:** Guardian Monitor
- **Company:** Gopher Industries

## Project Overview

Guardian is an activity monitoring and profiling system for the aged care sector with plans to
expand to residential homes. Guardians uses non-invasive radar technology to record a user's
activity and classify these activities over time. Guardians utilises the classified data to predict
possible physical and mental health conditions associated with that behaviour.

The Guardian Monitor's key features are:

1. Live updating of patient current activity.
2. Alerting the carer or nurse if a patient falls.
3. Having a profiling system to capture, edit and search patients.
4. Allowing each user to define the patient, carer and Admin users.
5. Generating dashboards about patient activity history.
6. Detecting changes in patients' physical health to suggest referrals.

Guardian's backend integrates an AI-driven system to facilitate the proposed features. This system can be thought as a pipeline, which terminates with a classification model that outputs the patient's activity in real-time. Such activities include, standing, sitting, lying down and more (exact activities not confirmed yet). This pipeline's architecture takes inspiration from several modern and cutting-edge publications in the research landscape that integrates Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and Machine Learning (ML). This emergent research area that has already demonstrated remarkable results. Our Guardian Monitor will too use this remarkable innovation to redefine modern healthcare.

##  AI-driven System

At the time of writing (end of T3 2023), **Guardian's AI engineers are to focus on tasks that lead up to key feature ONE**:
1. Live updating of patient current activity 
   
From the AI or ML perspective, no plans or progress have been made on any of the other key features.

The ML-oriented notes to approach key feature ONE will be summarised in the subsections below. However, to keep the handover document clean, please refer to [Guardian AI Document]('https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O0OyA2T06X0iOK-fld8PQn7jwCY1-Rdr/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110616284047482890831&rtpof=true&sd=true") for the detailed version.


### AI Pipeline's Logistics
Our AI-driven system presents a logistical challenge from the large amount of preliminary work. In short, the logic and process is listed below, where we work *backwards* from implemention to its foundation, step-by-step:
* The app knows the patient's real-time activity because it gets this data from the backend.
* The backend knows the patient's real-time activity because it is integrated with an AI pipeline.
* This AI pipeline's input is the raw signalling states from the sensors and its output is the patient's current activity.
* This pipeline is constantly receiving real-time streams of signalling states while also constantly giving real-time updates on the current activity. As a side-note, this means that while we are engineering the system, we need to make sure the latency (processing times) remains low.

At this point, the question to ask and answer is: "How does the AI pipeline learn the pattern that maps 'signal' to 'activity'?"
* We cannot inject a pipeline or model straight into the back-end and expect it to learn the real-time data "on the spot". 
* Therefore, the activity classification model at the end of this pipeline is to be derived or refined from a prebuilt and **pretrained model**.
* The pretrained model will be getting its 'training' from a publically available HAR dataset. 
* When building this pretrained model, we must consider it in the context of its **offline pipeline**. You can think of the offline pipeline as a sequence of 
* The components of the offline pipeline in sequence are: **Data Preprocessing**, **Feature Extraction** and the **Classification Model**. Each have their own subsection below.
This offline pipeline is where we are currently up to.

### Data Familiarisation 
* The aformentioned stages and components require a high-level understanding of the data in the pipeline. ie. Knowing what a signalling state means.
* There should also be some basic intuition behind the factors that influences signalling states (high-level only).
It is imperative that new Guardian AI engineers undergo pre-requisite learnings streamlined into a stage called **Data Familiarisation** before working on any pipeline components. 
**DO NOT SKIP DATA FAMILIARISATION JUST BECAUSE IT DOES NOT GIVE TANGIBLE RESULTS. YOU MUST KNOW WHAT THE DATA MEANS BEFORE TRYING TO BUILD A MODEL. THIS DIRECTIVE IS *EMPHASISED* BY DR. B. NAKISA (22/11/23). ALSO PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO SKIP THIS STAGE HAVE WASTED ENTIRE MONTHS.**

* Necessary topics mainly include:
  * how the data is collected
  * the significance of data collection parameters
  * how the information is contained inside the Wi-Fi band (very high-level)
  * the significance in the setup of the data collection environment 
  * the importance of a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) system in relation to HAR
  * multipath propagation (high-level) in relation to how it affects the data
  * channel state information (CSI) data 
  * knowing the fact that (don't need to know how) complex numbers represent wave properties (this is way easier than it sounds)

### Data Preprocessing
* Pre-processing is mostly just de-noising the raw data.
* De-noising removes variance in the data that do not carry information about motion.
* We have prototype codes for three de-noising techniques:
  * **PCA**
  * **wavelet-based de-noising**
  * **Gaussian Smoothing**  
* However, those prototypes likely still need improvement. Improvement suggestions include:
  * trying out the different orders in which we apply them
  * experimenting with a different parameters. For example 'threshold' for wavelet-denoising.
* We have not delved deeply into feature extraction yet, so we do not know how well those three functions will work or what exactly to improve.

### Data Preprocessing

   - Implement documented security recommendations.

## Open Issues

See [Trello Backlog](https://trello.com/b/jszQMoj0/major-product-1-guardian-monitor)

## Lessons Learned

This trimester the Guardian team faced delays whilst being unable to gain access to the Firebase Admin console.
In future, project teams should:

1. Request Firebase access early to ensure there are no delays that would limit backend work.
2. Continue investigating self-hosted backend options which are compatible with Firebase.
3. Ensure that contributions Guardian, regardless of their focus, store all their documentation in the same  

## Product Development Life Cycle

1. Use a simple branching strategy where a branch is raised for each task and a pull request is raised back to the master branch.
2. PRs should be reviewed by a team leader who is experienced in the area of development. Feedback should be given for improvements and applied.
3. Once approved by a reviewer, the PR can be merged if the CI run passes and there's no conflicts.

## New Tasks

Tasks can be created on the trello board by any team member.
Team member's are encouraged to create new tasks if they find bugs to be fixed, or have ideas for improvements.

## Definition of Done

When it is reviewed and tested. It must fulfill the specification of the Trello task. 

In terms of the AI system, pre-trained model will be considered done after it:
1. contains reference(s) to the model's source
2. has yielded reasonable evaluation metrics
Evaluation considerations include:
* the metrics used (consider class imbalance and the significance of False Positive and False Negatives of certain labels)
* the sample size, which may be quite low
* Several others to the future cohorts' discretion
3. has been peer reviewed by at least one other AI engineer
Another pair of eyes should verify whether the architecture is appropriate. 
4. has been verified by an AI consultant like Dr. B. Nakisa, before we can consider applying transfer learning.
  
## Task Review

Completed tasks will be reviewed by the project lead, or another member experienced with the task's domain. If the tasks are code oriented, members must provide clear comments to make the reviewing easier. 

In terms of reviewing tasks related to the AI pipeline, it is often unclear whether a component is sufficient or 'complete' before it is integrated with the subsequent components. If there is a strong consequence of doing the task wrong (ie. wastes a lot of time when discovered later) reviewal by the AI consultant is necessary. In practice, try to avoid thinking of a component as 'complete'. The entire pipeline is integrated so revisiting to older code is often inevitable. Improvements can often be added to old parts as new information reveals itself.

## Testing

1. Unit tests to validate the functionality of pure Kotlin and Java code (not Android specific)
2. Instrumented UI tests to validate UI behaviour
3. Manual tests
4. In terms of the AI development, quoting a high evaluation metric does not justify a prototype model 'passing the test'. Members must verify with peers to make sure that generalisation considerations are not missed. 

## Branching Strategy

A simple workflow is followed where tasks are completed in each developer's project fork.
After that a PR is raised to merge changes into the master branch of the primary Guardian repository.
