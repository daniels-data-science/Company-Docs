## Project Information

### Company Acting Director

- **Name:** Dr. Bahareh Nakisa

### Project Team

- **Project Name:** Guardian Monitor
- **Company:** Gopher Industries

## Project Overview

Guardian is an activity monitoring and profiling system for the aged care sector with plans to
expand to residential homes. Guardians uses non-invasive radar technology to record a user's
activity and classify these activities over time. Guardians utilises the classified data to predict
possible physical and mental health conditions associated with that behaviour.

The Guardian Monitor's key features are:

1. Live updating of patient current activity.
2. Alerting the carer or nurse if a patient falls.
3. Having a profiling system to capture, edit and search patients.
4. Allowing each user to define the patient, carer and Admin users.
5. Generating dashboards about patient activity history.
6. Detecting changes in patients' physical health to suggest referrals.

Guardian's backend integrates an AI-driven system to facilitate the proposed features. This system can be thought as a pipeline, which terminates with a classification model that outputs the patient's activity in real-time. Such activities include, standing, sitting, lying down and more (exact activities not confirmed yet). This pipeline's architecture takes inspiration from several and cutting-edge publications in the modern research landscape that integrates Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and Machine Learning (ML). This emergent research area has already demonstrated remarkable results. Our Guardian Monitor will too, use this same technology to redefine modern healthcare standards.

##  AI-driven System

At the time of writing (end of T3 2023), **Guardian's AI engineers are to focus on tasks that lead up to key feature ONE**, the "Live updating of patient current activity", via the HAR pipeline explained below. From the AI engineering perspective, no progress or plans have been made on any of the other key features yet.

The general procedure and notes to approach key feature ONE will be summarised in the subsections below. However, to keep the handover document clean for the general audience, please refer to our [Guardian AI Document]('https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O0OyA2T06X0iOK-fld8PQn7jwCY1-Rdr/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110616284047482890831&rtpof=true&sd=true") for the details. 

As a side note, prospective members that have experience in deep learning and researching literatures would benefit from becoming a Guardian AI engineer the most.

### AI Pipeline Logistics
Our AI-driven system presents a logistical challenge given the large amount of preliminary work. In short, the process is listed in dot-points below. 

* The app knows the patient's real-time activity because it will get this data from the backend.
* The backend will know the patient's real-time activity because it will be integrated with the AI-driven '**online pipeline**'.
* This 'online pipeline' will be engineered to constantly output low-latency updates on the current activity, based on real-time input.
* The online pipeline's input data will be a real-time stream of signalling states coming from the sensing devices in the patient's room.
* Real-time data cannot be used to immediately train the online HAR classification system "on the spot", so obtaining a **pretrained HAR classification model** that has a 'rough idea' of the real activity patterns in practice is necessary beforehand. Real-time data will be used to refine the pretrained model's learnings. 
* We need to need to begin construction of pipeline as an offline version because we need it to convert raw signals into a form that can be usable for training the pretrained model.
* **Feature Extraction** is the intermediate step between pre-processing the raw data and using its information to make the output classifications.
* The offline pipeline begins with **Data Preprocessing** component, which is largely about de-noising.
* The raw data that enters the offline pipeline will be from public dataset(s). This is opposed to the raw data that enters the online pipeline, which is real-time sensor readings.
  
The online pipeline will likely use similar structure to this offline pipeline. However, the details surrounding the online pipeline's implementational logistics and is not clear yet. As directed by Dr. B. Nakisa, we are currently working on just the offline component. The offline component's subsections are summarised in the section below.

### Data Familiarisation 
* The aformentioned stages and components require a high-level understanding of the data in the pipeline. ie. Knowing what a signalling state means.
* There should also be basic intuition behind the factors that influences signalling states (high-level only).
It is imperative that new Guardian AI engineers undergo this learning stage before working on any pipeline components. For ease the stage has been streamlined into a section called **Data Familiarisation** (see document and slides) 

* **DO NOT SKIP DATA FAMILIARISATION JUST BECAUSE IT DOES NOT GIVE TANGIBLE RESULTS.**
* **YOU MUST HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATA AND KNOW WHAT THE DATA MEANS BEFORE EVEN CONSIDERING THE MODEL. THIS DIRECTIVE IS *EMPHASISED* BY DR. B. NAKISA (22/11/23, first ML consultation session in T3 2023).**
* **PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO SKIP DATA FAMILIARISATION HAVE ALSO WASTED ENTIRE MONTHS.**

* Necessary topics are mainly:
  * how the data is collected.
  * the relevance of data collection parameters.
  * how the information is contained inside the Wi-Fi band (very high-level).
  * the significance in the setup of the data collection environment.
  * multipath propagation (high-level) in relation to how it affects the data.
  * the importance of Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) systems in relation to HAR.
  * channel state information (CSI) datasets.
  * knowing the fact that complex numbers are a representation of wave properties at a particular instance (this is way easier than it sounds)
  * Understand that signals can be expressed in both the time domain and the frequency domain.
  * Know that different techniques may demand the signal to be in one domain and not the other.


### Data Preprocessing
* Pre-processing is mostly just de-noising the raw data.
* De-noising removes variance in the data that do not carry information about motion.
* We have prototype codes for three de-noising techniques:
  * **PCA**
  * **wavelet-based de-noising**
  * **Gaussian Smoothing**  
* However, those prototypes likely still need improvement. Improvement suggestions include:
  * trying out the different orders in which we apply them
  * experimenting with a different parameters. For example 'threshold' for wavelet-denoising.
* We have not delved deeply into feature extraction yet, so we do not know how well those three functions will work or what exactly needs to improving.

### Feature Extraction and Classification Model
During this section it should be emphasised that **we should not be trying to build a model from scratch**. Instead we need to search existing literatures, especially those accompanied with code. Then re-apply existing ideas or integrate existing code into our architecture.  

Dr. B. Nakisa has directed us to investigate three pathways first:
1. Feature extraction using CNN followed by LSTM classifier
2. LSTM for this entiire pathway
3. Traditional feature extraction techniques followed by SVM

No progress has been made on the three techniques yet. I recommend trying SVM first as it seems the easiest.

## Roadmap

1. **Support Multi-Tenancy**
   - Enable multi-tenancy for the application databases.

2. **Backend Integration with AI system**
   - The section above explains the steps to take place before we can integrate the AI pipeline with Guardian's backend. 

3. **Nurse User Feature Set**
   - Complete the nurse user feature set.

4. **Theming Update**
   - Update theming to match the Caretaker profile color palette (darker blue, flat icons).

5. **Google Sign-In Integration**
   - Integrate backend with Google Sign-In (enable in Firebase Authentication service).

6. **Database Integration**
   - Integrate database with heart rate data.
   - Integrate database with the patient archive list.
   - Integrate database with the nurse task list, allowing nurses to be assigned tasks by admins.

7. **Self-Hosted Backend Connection**
   - Allow application users to optionally connect to a self-hosted backend within the app.

8. **Security Implementation**
   - Implement documented security recommendations.

## Open Issues

See [Trello Backlog](https://trello.com/b/jszQMoj0/major-product-1-guardian-monitor)

## Lessons Learned

This trimester the Guardian team faced delays whilst being unable to gain access to the Firebase Admin console.

In future, project teams should:

1. Request Firebase access early to ensure there are no delays that would limit backend work.
2. Continue investigating self-hosted backend options which are compatible with Firebase.
3. Ensure that contributions Guardian, regardless of their focus, store all their documentation in the same

### Sensor from previous cohort deemed unfit
This semester, it was confirmed that a sensor purchased by a previous cohort is unsuitable for Guardian's purposes. Time was expended researching it before it was confirmed that we are not using this sensor. The takeaway is that we need to research an asset's suitability *before* committing or purchasing to it. 

For reference, it is this [sensor]("https://www.seeedstudio.com/60GHz-mmWave-Radar-Sensor-Breathing-and-Heartbeat-Module-p-5305.html"). See [research notes]("LINK_HERE") surrounding this sensor. Do not consider it if it comes up again.

## Product Development Life Cycle

1. Use a simple branching strategy where a branch is raised for each task and a pull request is raised back to the master branch.
2. PRs should be reviewed by a team leader who is experienced in the area of development. Feedback should be given for improvements and applied.
3. Once approved by a reviewer, the PR can be merged if the CI run passes and there's no conflicts.

## New Tasks

Tasks can be created on the trello board by any team member.
Team member's are encouraged to create new tasks if they find bugs to be fixed, or have ideas for improvements.

## Definition of Done

Overall a task is 'done' after it fulfills the specification of a Trello task, then is reviewed and tested. 

In terms of the AI system, the pre-trained model will be considered done after it:
1. contains reference(s) to the model's source
2. has yielded reasonable evaluation metrics
Evaluation considerations include:
* the metrics used (consider class imbalance and the significance of False Positive and False Negatives of certain labels)
* the sample size, which may be quite low
* Several others to the future cohorts' discretion
3. has been peer reviewed by at least one other AI engineer
Another pair of eyes should verify whether the architecture is appropriate. 
4. has been verified by an AI consultant like Dr. B. Nakisa, before we can consider applying transfer learning.
  
## Task Review

Completed tasks will be reviewed by the project lead, or another member experienced with the task's domain. If the tasks are code oriented, members must provide clear comments to make the reviewing easier. 

In terms of reviewing tasks related to the AI pipeline, it is often unclear whether a component is sufficient or 'complete' before it is integrated with the subsequent components. If there is a strong consequence of doing the task wrong (ie. wastes a lot of time when discovered later) reviewal by the AI consultant is necessary. In practice, try to avoid thinking of a component as 'complete'. The entire pipeline is integrated so revisiting to older code is often inevitable. Improvements can often be added to old parts as new information reveals itself.

## Testing

1. Unit tests to validate the functionality of pure Kotlin and Java code (not Android specific)
2. Instrumented UI tests to validate UI behaviour
3. Manual tests
4. In terms of the AI development, quoting a high evaluation metric does not justify a prototype model 'passing the test'. Members must verify with peers to make sure that generalisation considerations are not missed. 

## Branching Strategy

A simple workflow is followed where tasks are completed in each developer's project fork.
After that a PR is raised to merge changes into the master branch of the primary Guardian repository.
